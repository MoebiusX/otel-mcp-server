# KrystalineX – Institutional-Grade Crypto Exchange & Observability Demo Platform

KrystalineX is an **institutional-grade cryptocurrency exchange** engineered around a
"Proof of Observability™" philosophy. Every action — from the browser's click to a
matcher's trade decision — is captured in an end-to-end distributed trace, fed into a
statistical anomaly engine, and — when something looks wrong — analyzed by a fine‑tuned
LLM that explains **what went wrong and how to fix it**.

> **Why it exists**Vz
> *Demonstrate how modern observability, AI, and cryptography can be combined to build
> transparent, auditable, and self‑diagnosing infrastructure.*

- 4 micro‑services with **17+ spans per trace** and full W3C context propagation over
  RabbitMQ
- Automated **latency & amount anomaly detection** using time‑aware baselines and
  Welford's online algorithm
- **AI‑powered root‑cause analysis** via a LoRA‑tuned Llama 3.2:1B model (hosted by
  Ollama), streamed to the UI in real time
- **Zero‑knowledge proofs** (zk‑SNARKs) for tamper‑proof trade commitments and solvency
- **34 alerting rules** across 7 groups with escalation via GoAlert (SMS/voice) and ntfy
  (push)
- Comprehensive telemetry: OpenTelemetry → OTEL Collector → Jaeger, Prometheus, Loki,
  Grafana — see [Observability Whitepaper](docs/OBSERVABILITY_WHITEPAPER.md)
- 940+ automated tests (Vitest + Playwright); production‑grade Docker‑Compose &
  Kubernetes manifests

## High‑level architecture

```text
  [kx-wallet (Browser)]                              [Jaeger]   [Prometheus]
        ↓ HTTP + OTEL spans
     [Kong API Gateway] ──────┐
          ↓ proxy + context   │      [Loki]     [Grafana]    [Alertmanager]
   [kx-exchange API] ────┐   ├──→ [RabbitMQ] ──→ [kx-matcher] ──→ ZK proof gen

                                        ↓                              ↓
                                  SEV 1-5 classification        WebSocket → Live UI
                                        ↓
                                  alerting rules (34) → Alertmanager → GoAlert / ntfy
```

All components emit OpenTelemetry spans and metrics; traces carry W3C context
through RabbitMQ headers so the full path of a trade can be reconstructed.

## Key features

### 🔄 Trading & wallet
- BTC/USD spot market with **live Binance WebSocket price feed**
- BUY/SELL orders with fill price, slippage, and fair‑band logic
- Multi‑user wallet service (`kx-wallet`) with `kx1`‑style addresses and balance
  validation
- Peer‑to‑peer transfers between users (transfer page, `/api/transfers`)

### 🔐 Authentication & security
- Email registration/verification (MailDev for local)
- JWT access + refresh tokens, secure logout, session management
- Optional TOTP‑based two‑factor authentication
- Three‑tier rate limiting (global, auth, sensitive operations)
- Security event metrics for brute‑force / credential‑stuffing detection

### ⚠️ Anomaly detection

Adaptive, time‑aware anomaly detection across two dimensions:

**Latency anomalies** — trace duration baselines maintained per
`service:operation` across **168 time buckets** (7 days × 24 hours):
- Statistics (mean, σ, sample count) computed via **Welford's online algorithm**
  for numerically stable, single‑pass updates
- **Adaptive percentile thresholds** learned from historical deviation
  distributions (not fixed multipliers)
- **SEV 5** (80th %) → **SEV 1** (99.9th %) classification with multi‑level
  fallback lookup (exact bucket → same‑hour → same‑day → global)
- Baselines persisted in PostgreSQL and merged additively using pooled variance

**Amount anomalies** — "whale alerts" with 6‑order‑of‑magnitude sensitivity:
- Enable with `ENABLE_AMOUNT_ANOMALY_DETECTION=true`
- Passive 🐋 WHALE ALERT logging and `/api/monitor/amount-anomalies` endpoint

  [Anomaly Detection Design](docs/observability/02_ANOMALY_DETECTION_DESIGN.md)

### 🧠 AI‑powered analysis

A LoRA‑fine‑tuned **Llama 3.2:1B** model provides natural‑language root‑cause
analysis for detected anomalies:

- **Real‑time streaming** — anomalies batched in 30‑second windows, analyzed via
  Ollama, and streamed token‑by‑token to the UI over WebSocket
- **8 use‑case detection patterns** (P0/P1/P2 priority) covering latency spikes,
  error bursts, queue backlogs, and more
- **Structured output** — every diagnosis contains
  `SUMMARY / CAUSES / RECOMMENDATIONS / CONFIDENCE`
- **Human feedback loop** — 👍/👎 ratings collected in‑app → stored as training
  examples → exported as JSONL for retraining

**Fine‑tuning pipeline:**

| Step | Tool / File |
|------|-------------|
| Generate synthetic data (100+ samples) | `scripts/generate-synthetic-training.cjs` |
| Validate combined dataset | `scripts/validate-training-data.cjs` |
| LoRA training (`r=16, α=32`, q/k/v/o projections) | [axolotl-config.yaml](axolotl-config.yaml) |
| Merge & quantize → GGUF | `llama.cpp` convert |
| Deploy to Ollama | `ollama create anomaly-analyzer` |

122+ training samples ship with the repo (22 hand‑crafted + 100 synthetic).

### 🔐 Zero‑knowledge proofs

Circom‑based zk‑SNARK circuits provide **tamper‑proof trade commitments** and
**solvency proofs**:

**Trade integrity (Phase 3)** — 5‑input Poseidon commitment:

| # | Signal | What it proves |
|---|--------|----------------|
| 1 | `fillPrice` | Exact execution price (scaled integer) |
| 2 | `quantity` | Exact trade quantity |
| 3 | `userId` | Cryptographic user attribution |
| 4 | `timestamp` | Temporal commitment — cannot be backdated |
| 5 | `traceId` | OTel trace binding — cannot be forged or swapped |

~680 constraints, well within 2^12 Powers of Tau ceremony limits.

**Tampering vectors closed by Phase 3:**
- ❌ Alter fill price or quantity
- ❌ Attribute trade to wrong user
- ❌ Backdate or future‑date a trade
- ❌ Forge, swap, or disassociate OTel traces

**Solvency proofs** — demonstrate on‑chain balances exceed liabilities.

Proofs generated by `snarkjs` during order execution and stored with trade
events.

| Group | Examples | Severity |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Application | `HighErrorRate`, `ServiceDown`, `NoTraffic` | critical/warning |
| Trading | `OrderProcessingFailures`, `PriceFeedUnavailable`, `OrderQueueCritical` | critical/warning |
| Database | `PostgreSQLDown`, `DatabaseConnectionsCritical`, `SlowQueries` | critical/warning |
| RabbitMQ | `RabbitMQDown`, `RabbitMQNoConsumers`, `ConsumerLag` | critical/warning |

## Running & testing

### Manual testing (dev)
1. Start stack with `npm run dev`.
2. Register/login via UI; verify email at <http://localhost:1080>.
3. Place orders or perform transfers; watch Jaeger (<http://localhost:16686>)
   and Grafana dashboards.
4. Trigger anomalies by throttling responses or submitting extreme amounts.

### Multi‑user transfer test
1. Register a second account.
2. Navigate to the Transfer page.
3. Enter recipient's `kx1…` wallet address and amount.
4. Verify balance updates for both users.

### Automated tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e      # end‑to‑end (Playwright)
npm run test:unit     # unit tests (Vitest)
```
